    <p>Bootstrap is an HTML, CSS and JavaScript Framework and it is useful to develop responsive websites without rewriting the code for each device or screen. If you code once, it just works for any browser, device, and screen. Bootstrap has not only HTML/CSS components but also JS components. With Bootstrap you get to use common HTML elements but with a beautiful representation of items. Finally, you can use your own theme on top of Bootstrap making your code the most customizable ever.Bootstrap was developed and announced on August 2011 by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton while working at Twitter. The purpose of the development was to make interface development and maintenance very easy and consistent. Bootstrap was not only a framework but a way to make some common design patterns a standard in web design and development. In the beginning the project was called Twitter Blueprint but later on it was renamed to Bootstrap and released as an open-source projectBootstrap was developed and announced on August 2011 by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton while working at Twitter.
